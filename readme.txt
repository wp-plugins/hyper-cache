Hyper Cache is an extremely aggressive cache for WordPress.

== Description ==

Hyper Cache is a really aggressive cache for WordPress. This cache helps
in solving the low resources problems of many hosting provider, specially
when the is big slowness or timeout in the mysql side.

The cache reduces the database queries to _zero_ serving cached
page _without activate_ wordpress. The cache can serve _gzip_
compressed page to lower the bandwith usage and/or optimized html
pages.

There are drawbacks to obtain such performances, check the plugin
page on my site.
