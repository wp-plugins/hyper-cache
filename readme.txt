Hyper Cache is flexible and easy to configure cache system for WordPress.

== Description ==

New! Version 3.0 has been rewritten. Be patient if some bugs are present and report
me any issue. Thank you.

Hyper Cache is a new cache system for WordPress, specifically written for
people which have their blogs on low resources hosting provider
(cpu and mysql). It works even with hosting based on Microsoft IIS (just tuning
the configuration). It has three invalidation method: all the cache, single post
based and nothing but with control on home and archive pages invalidation.

More can be read on the [official plugin page](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/hyper-cache).
