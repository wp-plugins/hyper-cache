Hyper Cache is an extremely aggressive cache for WordPress.

== Description ==

Hyper Cache is an experimental really aggressive cache for WordPress. I wrote it because my hosting provider is very low in resources, particulary on the mysql side.

The cache tries to reduce the database queries to zero.

To install, please read carefully the instructions on:
